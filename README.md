# Algo Arsenal

A complete, public roadmap for mastering DSA from zero to interview ready with Python. Based on InstaByte's **DSA Master** guide.

---

## 🧩 Sections Overview

### 1. Data Structure–Specific Algorithms  
Implement everything unless noted:
- **Arrays**: Quick & Merge Sort, Binary Search, Two Pointers, Sliding Window  
- **Linked Lists**: Node traversal, insertion, deletion, reversal, cycle detection  
- **Hash Tables**, **Stacks**, **Queues**: **Theory only**, no code required  
- **Trees**: Traversal (BFS/DFS), BST search  
- **Heaps**: Conceptual, plus optional implementation exercises  
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, cycle detection, Dijkstra’s shortest-path  
- **Tries**: Full implementation, insertion, search, autocomplete  
- **Union-Find**: Core implementation, operations + cycle detection

### 2. General Algorithms  
Implement from scratch:
- **Recursion**: Factorial, DFS, tree recursion  
- **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci, knapsack (0/1 & unbounded)  
- **Greedy**: Kruskal’s MST  
- **Backtracking**: N‑Queens, Sudoku solver

## ⚙️ Structure & File Guidelines

Each section has:
- An overview README
- Python implementation files, each with:
  - Explanation & prompting docstring
  - Time and space complexity
  - Example usage and edge cases

Concept-only folders (hash_tables, stacks, queues) have README guides pointing to external references.

---

## ✅ How to Use

1. Follow the numbered roadmap in [progress.md]  
2. For each topic:
   - Read overview
   - Analyze code
   - Run and extend (try adding edge cases)
3. Optional: run unit tests in the `tests/` folder  
4. After coding basics, solve related LeetCode problems (see `Interview Master 100`)

---

## 🛠 Tech Setup

- Python 3.x  
- (Optional) `pytest` for tests  
- No extra dependencies

---

## 📌 Why It Works

- Builds strong conceptual understanding  
- Covers theory *and* implementation  
- Prepares you for both whiteboard & real-world code interviews  
- Open roadmap encourages collaboration & contributions

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Complete basic implementation  
- Solve 4-5 easy LeetCode problems per topic  
- Dive deeper into medium/hard problems  
- Track your progress in `progress.md`
